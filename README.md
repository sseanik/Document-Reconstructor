# Paper-Reconstructor
Tools to reconstruct shredded paper documents as my 'Something Awesome' project for my Security Engineering Course

My lecturer Richard Buckland, spoke about the aspect of physical security and how he would shred a document, shred the shreds, eat some of them, throw different pieces into different bins and burn the rest. The more common approach would either be to crunch up the paper or just shred it.

I was intrigued, so I wanted to learn about the possibility of programmatically reconstructing a shredded document. I have no computer vision background whatsoever, this was more for my security curiosity.
